	Use:   "jarvis",
	Short: "Assist you to read ethereum contract and do ethereum tx easily",
	Long: fmt.Sprintf(`Jarvis is a command line tool to assist ethereum dapp operators to do their
daily tasks such as reading smart contracts and doing operational transactions.

Jarvis supports you on different ends:

	1. It manages your ethereum accounts so you dont have to
	remember which address is with which kind of key like keystores,
	trezor, ledger...

	2. It manages a book of addresses so you will not forget one, easily
	look them up and will show you address information to improve tx's
	verbosity.

	3. It helps you to read smart contract and do transactions with
	intuitive command line interface.

By default, Jarvis uses the following nodes to support different chains: %s
You can also add your custom node by setting the following env vars: %s
In case you want many custom nodes, you can define it in ~/nodes.json with format describe at
https://github.com/tranvictor/jarvis#configure-custom-nodes

Jarvis also utilizes chain explorers like Etherscan, Bscscan and Tomoscan in order to look
up additional informations such as contract ABI, recommended gas price..etc. By default,
Jarvis uses default API keys. You can also specify your API keys (recommended to make
Jarvis more stable) by setting the following env vars: %s

Note: Jarvis will only check if the env vars are not empty and take the env vars blindly,
it will not check if it is a valid url or not, the error will pop up during its command
execution instead.
